function updateGradeFromFaculty(studentNumber, classCode, gradeData) {
    // Updates student grades in real-time
}

// Simulate grade updates (for testing)
function simulateGradeUpdate(classCode, gradeType, newGrade) {
    // Demonstrates real-time functionality
}
```

### Authentication
- Integrated with existing login system
- Session management with localStorage
- Token-based authentication ready for backend

### Data Structure
Mock data structure matches real requirements:
```javascript
{
    classCode: '7024',
    courseNumber: 'NSTP-CWTS 1', 
    units: 3,
    prelimGrade: null,
    midtermGrade: null,
    tentativeFinalGrade: null,
    finalGrade: 'Not Yet Submitted',

}
```
